# NaNoGenMo-2015

An attempt to generate a book that has the structure of a normal novel, but is made up entirely of Roman Numerals from 1 to 50,000.

Roman Numerals start getting ugly very soon and without support for large numbers, 50,000 becomes MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM (50 M's) which is not that nice. This book uses the system where the overlined letters are multiplied by 1,000, however overlines cannot be used in the text file, so it is represented as '='. So, the number V=V would be 5*1,000 + 5 (5,005)
