# NaNoGenMo-2015

An attempt to generate a book that has the structure of a normal novel, but is made up entirely of Roman Numerals from 1 to 50,000.

Roman Numerals start off quite nicely, but soon start getting ugly; without support for large numbers, 50,000 becomes MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM (50 M's) which is not that nice. This book uses the system where the overlined letters would be multiplied by 1,000, however since overlines cannot be used in the text file, I just represent them as '='. So, the number V=V would be 5*1,000 + 5 (5,005). Additionally, the PDF uses small capitals rather than overlines, but for presentation purposes.

The style of this book, has been loosly inspired by Terry Pratchett's Dodger, although there are some things missing:
- italic words;
- ellipsis;
- em dashes;
- any vague resemblance of a story.
